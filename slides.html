# Counting

- Although this lecture is indeed related to the concepts of cardinality, (how many things are there), we instead go deeper into slightly more complicated "*how many*" questions.

# Basic Rules of Counting

---
# Basic Rules of Counting

- Counting **combinations** of related things become more interesting.
- Suppose you have a two **disjoint** sets of things called **$A$** and **$B$**, how do you count the number of **unique combinations** of the elements of **$A$** and **$B$**?


---

# The Product Rule

- Given a procedure with two tasks, if there are **$n_1$** ways to perform the first task and **$n_2$** ways to perform the second task, then there are **$n_1 n_2$** ways to perform the whole procedure.


---

# The Product Rule

- For example, let **$A=\{a,b,c,d\}$**, **$B=\{x,y,z\}$**, if you list down **all** of the **possible combinations** this way:


---

# The Product Rule

|  | **$a$** | **$b$** | **$c$** | **$d$** |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **$x$** | **$ax$** | **$bx$** | **$cx$** | **$dx$** |
| **$y$** | **$ay$** | **$by$** | **$cy$** | **$dy$** |
| **$z$** | **$az$** | **$bz$** | **$cz$** | **$dz$** |


---

# The Product Rule

- Since there are **$|A|=4$** columns and **$|B|=3$** rows, then there are **$(4)(3)$** unique combinations.


---

# The Product Rule

- This can be generalized into **$|S_1|=n_1$** rows and **$|S_2|=n_2$** columns.
- Therefore the number of unique combinations are indeed **$n_1 n_2$**.


---

# Examples

- How many unique plate number combinations can you produce out of the pattern: 3 letters and 3 numbers.
- How many unique 8-bit strings can be formed
- How many ways can you place 2 unique rings in your ten fingers?
- How many functions are there if the domain has **$u$** elements and the range has **$v$** elements?
- How many injective functions are there if the domain has **$u$** elements and the range has **$v$** elements?


---

# Examples

- As demonstrated in the first example, the product rule can be **extended**, to not just for two tasks.
- For a procedure composed of **$m$** tasks, **$T_1$**, **$T_2$**, **$T_3$**, ..., **$T_m$**, the number of ways to perform the whole procedure is **$n_1 n_2 n_3 \cdots n_m$**.


---

# Examples

- Supposing you have two disjoint sets again, **$A$** and **$B$**, how many things of either **$A$** or **$B$** are there?


---

# Sum Rule

- If a task can be done **either** in one of **$n_1$** ways or in **$n_2$** ways, (supposing each way is unique), there are **$n_1 + n_2$** ways to perform the specific task.


---

# Sum Rule

- For example let let **$A=\{a,b,c,d\}$**, **$B=\{x,y,z\}$**, the cardinality of the **$|A \cup B|$** is simply **$|A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$**.
- Since **$A$** and **$B$** are assumed to be disjoint (because each way is supposed to be unique), then we simply add the cardinalities of the two sets **$A$** and **$B$**.


---

# Examples

- If each character of a password can either be a letter, number, or an underscore. How many different ways can one character be.
- How many unique passwords of length 5 can you create?
- How many unique passwords of length 5-8 can you create?


---

# Examples

> If we remove the assumption that the set of ways are disjoint, all we have to do is to subtract the cardinality of their intersection.


---

# Subtraction Rule

- If a task can be done either in one of **$n_1$** ways or in **$n_2$** ways and there are **$m$** ways common between two sets of ways,  there are **$n_1 + n_2-m$** ways to perform the specific task.


---

# Subtraction Rule

- If **$H$** is the set of horror movies, **$T$** is the set of thriller movies and **$D$** is the set of drama movies. How many movies are either horror, thriller, or drama?


---

# Division Rule

- If a task can be carried out **$n$** ways but there are exactly **$d$** identical ways for every unique way, there are **$\frac{n}{d}$** unique ways.


---

# Example

- How many ways can you label four corners of a square with the labels, **$\{A,B,C,D\}$**? Assuming no labels can repeat and that rotating the labels along the corners does not create a unique labelling?

# Permutations and Combinations

---
# Permutations and Combinations

- Some of the examples that were described in the previous sections relate to a particular types of **counting problems**.
- These counting problems involve counting the number of **arrangements** and **combinations**.


---

class: center, middle
# Permutations

---
# Permutations

> How many ordered 3-tuples (where none of the elements repeat) can you describe from a set of 5 objects?


---

# Permutations

- Since we are counting **tuples** (not subsets), the **order** of the elements matter (i.e.
- **$(a,b,c)\neq(b,a,c)$**.


---

# Permutations

- This gives the solution via product rule, **$5(4)(3)$**.


---

# Permutations

- A **permutation** of a set of objects, is an ordered tuple (where each element is pairwise distinct) of the objects.
- An **$r$-permutation** on the other hand, is an ordered tuple (where each element is pairwise district) of any size **$r$** subset of the set.


---

# Permutations

- For example given the set **$S=\{a,b,c,d\}$**, **$(a,b,c,d)$** and **$(a,c,b,d)$** are some permutations of **$S$**.
- The ordered tuple **$(a,c,d)$** is a 3-permutation of **$S$**, and **$(b,d)$** is a 2-permutation of **$S$**.


---

# Permutations

- The number of **$r$**-permutations of any given set with **$n$** elements is denoted by **$P(n,r)$** or **$^nP_r$**.
- We can derive the general formula for **$P(n,r)$** using the product rule.


---

# Permutations

> If **$n$** is a positive integer and **$r$** is an integer where **$1\leq r\leq n$**. $$ P(n,r)=n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots(n-r+1) $$


---

# Permutations

> <div> $$ \begin{aligned} P(n,r)&=\frac{n!}{(n-r)!} \\P(n,r)&=\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots(n-r+1)(n-r)(n-r-1)(n-r-2)\cdots(1)}{(n-r)(n-r-1)(n-r-2)\cdots(1)} \\ \end{aligned} $$ </div>
> The product **$(n-r)(n-r-1)(n-r-2)\cdots(1)$** gets cancelled out leaving:
> <div> $$ P(n,r)=n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots(n-r+1) \\ $$ </div>


---

# Permutations

- How many ways can you award the first, second and third price in contest with 50 participants.
- How many different poker hands (5 cards) where the order matters are there in a deck of 52.


---

# Combinations

---
# Combinations

- While a permutation is associated to an ordered tuple, a combination is associated to a **subset**.


---

# Combinations

> How many subsets of size 3 can you describe from a set of 5 objects?


---

# Combinations

- Since we are now counting subsets we need to take note that **set equality** behaves differently.
- **$\{a,b,c\}=\{b,a,c\}$**).


---

# Combinations

- To answer this counting problem, all we need to do is to apply the **division** rule after calculating the number of permutations:


---

# Combinations

> <div> $$ \begin{aligned} S&=\{a,b,c,d,e\} \\ \\\{a,b,c\}&\to\Bigg\{\begin{matrix}(a,b,c)\\(b,c,a)\\\vdots\\(b,a,c)\\\end{matrix} \\ \\ \end{aligned} $$ </div>


---

# Combinations

> <div> $$ \begin{aligned} \{b,c,d\}&\to\Bigg\{\begin{matrix}(b,c,d)\\(c,d,b)\\\vdots\\(d,c,b)\\\end{matrix} \\ \\ \end{aligned} $$ </div>


---

# Combinations

> <div> $$ \begin{aligned} &\vdots \\ \\\{c,d,e\}&\to\Bigg\{\begin{matrix}(c,d,e)\\(d,c,e)\\\vdots\\(e,c,d)\\\end{matrix} \\ \end{aligned} $$ </div>


---

# Combinations

- Since one combination is actually equivalent to **$P(3,3)$** permutations.
- We simply divide the total amount of 3-permutations by **$P(3,3)$**.
- Which is **$\frac{60}{6}=10$** combinations.
- This gives us the formula for **$r$-combinations** from a set of **$n$** elements:


---

# Combinations

> <div> $$ \begin{aligned} C(n,r)&=\frac{P(n,r)}{P(r,r)} \\C(n,r)&=\frac{\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}}{\frac{r!}{(r-r)!}} \\C(n,r)&=\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \\ \end{aligned} $$ </div>


---

# Combinations

- The number of **$r$** combinations in a set of **$n$** elements has, is denoted as **$C(n,r)$**.
- It also usually denoted using **${n\choose r}$**


---

# Combinations

- In a 6/42 lottery ticket, you select a set of **$6$** positive integers from a set of **$42$** positive integers. How many unique lottery tickets are there?
- Given a sorted list 6 unique numbers, how many sorted sublists are there
- How many bit strings of length 7 are there with exactly 3 zeroes?
- In the binomial expansion of **$(x+y)^3$**, what is the coefficient of **$x^2y$**.

# Binomial Theorem

---
# Binomial Theorem

- Looking back at the previous example, we can see how we are able to use combinatorial truths to figure out the coefficient of a term in the expansion of the binomial **$(x+y)^3$**.
- As it turns out the same reasoning can be used for any binomial expansion **$(x+y)^n$**.


---

# Binomial Theorem

- In the following binomial, the expansion is found by adding all possible combinations of **$x$**'s and **$y$**'s from all **$(x+y)$**.


---

# Binomial Theorem

<div>
$$
(x+y)^n=\underbrace{(x+y)(x+y)\cdots(x+y)}_n
$$
</div>

---

# Binomial Theorem

<div>
$$
cx^iy^{n-i}=cu_1u_2\cdots u_n
$$
</div>

---

# Binomial Theorem

- where **$u_i$** is either **$x$** or **$y$** and the coefficient **$c$** is the number of times the exact combination of **$x$** and **$y$** is repeated.
- Therefore, to figure out the coefficient of some arbitrary term **$x^iy^{n-i}$** in the binomial expansion, you just have to answer the combinatorial question:


---

# Binomial Theorem

> how many **$u_1u_2\cdots u_n$** are there where there are exactly **$i$** **$x$**'s?


---

# Binomial Theorem

> how many bit stings of length **$n$** are there with exactly **$i$** zeroes?


---

# Binomial Theorem

- Which can be calculated using **$C(n,i)$**.


---

# Binomial Theorem

<div>
$$
\begin{aligned}
(x+y)^n&=\sum_{i=0}^{n}{{n \choose i}x^iy^{n-i}}\\
(x+y)^n&={n \choose 0}y^{n}+{n \choose 1}x^1y^{n-1}+\cdots+{n \choose n}x^n
\end{aligned}
$$
</div>

---

# Binomial Theorem

> For the first and the last element's **$x^0$** and **$y^0$** are ommited.


---

# Binomial Theorem

- For example the coefficient of the term **$x^{21} y^{13}$** of the binomial **$(x+y)^{34}$**:


---

# Binomial Theorem

<div>
$$
{34 \choose 21}x^{21}y^{13}=927983760x^{21}y^{13}
$$
</div>

---

# Binomial Theorem

> What is the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of a binomial on the **$n$th** degree?


---

# Binomial Theorem

<div>
$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{i=0}^{n}{n \choose i}&=\sum_{i=0}^{n}{n \choose i}1^i 1^{n-i}\\
\sum_{i=0}^{n}{n \choose i}&=(1+1)^n\\
\sum_{i=0}^{n}{n \choose i}&=2^n
\end{aligned}
$$
</div>

---

# Binomial Theorem

- Which actually make sense if you answer the question using the product rule since you there are 2 ways (selecting either **$x$** or **$y$**) in each of the **$n$** tasks in the whole procedure.
- This also makes sense on the context of bit strings since there are exactly **$2^n$** unique bit strings of length **$n$**.


---

# Binomial Theorem

<div>
$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{i=0}^{n}{(-1)^i{n \choose i}}&=\sum_{i=0}^{n}{n \choose i}(-1)^i 1^{n-i}\\
\sum_{i=0}^{n}{(-1)^i{n \choose i}}&=(-1+1)^n\\
\sum_{i=0}^{n}{(-1)^i {n \choose i}}&=0^n=0
\end{aligned}

# Finite Probability Space

---
# Finite Probability Space

- **experiment** - in the context of probability an experiment is a procedure that results to exactly one outcome out of a set of possible outcomes.
- **sample space** - we call the set of possible outcomes of a particular experiment its corresponding sample space
- **event** - an event is a subset of the sample space


---

# Finite Probability Space

> if **$S$** is a **finite** nonempty sample space of equally likely outcomes, and **$E$** is an event, given that **$E \subset S$**, The probability of event **$E$**, (denoted by **$p(E)$**):
> <div> $$ p(E)=\frac{|E|}{|S|} \\ $$ </div>


---

# Finite Probability Space

- The probability of an event can only be between **$0$** to **$1$**.
- That is because the **$E$** is a subset of **$S$**.
- Therefore, we can conclude that its cardinality is greater than or equal to **$0$** and less than or equal to **$|S|$** ($0 \leq |E| \leq |S|$).


---

# Finite Probability Space

- For example, given a box that contains 3 oranges, 6 apples, and 2 bananas, what is the probability that a fruit chosen at random from the box is an **orange**?


---

# Finite Probability Space

- Since there are  3 oranges, the probability for choosing an orange can be calculated as: **$\frac{3}{11}$**.


---

# Examples

- Given the same scenario above, what is the probability that two fruits selected at random are both bananas?
- What is the probability that a ticket wins the 6/49​ lottery? Selecting a combination of 6 numbers from 1 to 49.
- After uniformly shuffling the list **$[3,2,1,1,4,5]$**, what is the probability that the shuffling produces a sorted list?


---

# Probabilities of unions of events

- If your looking for the probability that either one of two events **$E$** or **$F$** occurs (where both **$E$** and **$F$** are subsets of **$S$**), you can simply combine the two events into one event which corresponds to their union.
- Since this union is still the subset of the sample space **$S$**, you can use Laplace's definition to find the probability:


---

# Probabilities of unions of events

<div>
$$
\begin{aligned}
p(E \cup F) &= \frac{|E|+|F|-|E \cap F|}{|S|}\\
&= \frac{|E|}{|S|}+\frac{|F|}{|S|}-\frac{|E \cap F|}{|S|}\\
\\
p(E \cup F) &= p(E) + p(F) + p(E \cap F)
\end{aligned}
$$
</div>

---

# Probabilities of complements

- We can leverage the fact that since event **$E$** is a subset of **$S$**, then the set difference **$S-E$** (which is also a subset of **$S$**), corresponds to all events where **$E$** is not the outcome.
- That is because **$S-E$** is literally the set of all outcomes that are not **$E$**.
- This leads us to the formula for the probability of the **complement** of an event, (denoted by **$p(\overline{E})$**):


---

# Probabilities of complements

<div>
$$
\begin{aligned}
p(\overline{E}) &= p(S-E)\\
&=\frac{|S-E|}{|S|}\\
&=\frac{|S|-|E|}{|S|}\\
&=1-\frac{|E|}{|S|}\\
\\
p(\overline{E})&=1-p(E)
\end{aligned}
$$
</div>

---

# Probabilities of complements

- This principle is very useful since there are times where the **complement** of an event is much **easier** to identify than the event itself.


---

# Probabilities of complements

- (Given **$E$** as the event where the random bit string has at least one zero)


---

# Probabilities of complements

<div>
$$
\begin{aligned}
p(E)&=1-P(\overline{E})\\
&=1-\frac{|\overline{E}|}{|S|}\\
&=1-\frac{1}{2^8}\\
&=1-\frac{1}{256}\\
\\
p(E)&=\frac{255}{256}
\end{aligned}
$$

# Probability theory

---
# Probability theory

- Laplace's definition for the probability of an event in a finite sample space assumes that all possible outcomes have **equal** likelihood to occur.
- This cannot be assumed for all experiments in the **real world** since some outcomes are actually more likely than the others.
- A coin may be **biased** in such a way that outcome of flipping to one specific side is more likely, than the other side.


---

# Probability theory

- The definition for probability can be generalized for finite probability space experiments that **don't** have equally likely outcomes.
- This is done by assigning a specific probability **$p(s)$** for each outcome **$s \in S$**.
- The assignment of specific probabilities can only be valid if **$0 \leq p(s) \leq 1$** for each outcome **$s$**, and that **$\sum_{s \in S}{p(s)}=1$** (each probability is within the range **$[0,1]$**, and the sum of all probabilities is exactly **$1$**).


---

# Probability theory

- This definition of probability describes the function, **$p:S\to [0,1]$**, known as the **probability distribution** for the particular experiment.
- The correct assignment of each probability **$p(S)$** should satisfy the limit:


---

# Probability theory

<div>
$$
\lim_{n\to \infty}{\frac{u}{n}}=p(s)
$$
</div>

---

# Probability theory

- Given that after performing the experiment **$n$** times, the outcome **$s$** occurred **$u$** times.
- For example, as you increase the number of times you flip an unbiased coin, the ratio of flipping heads divided by the number of flips should approach **$\frac{1}{2}$**.


---

# Probability theory

> Given the sample space for flipping a coin, **$S=\{H,T\}$**:
> - **$p(H)=0.5001$**
- $p(T)=0.4999$


---

# Probability theory

- A probability distribution such as the above which follows Laplace's assumption of having equally likely outcomes, is called a **uniform distribution**.
- This implies that a uniformly distributed experiment will have a probability assignment **$p(s)=\frac{1}{n}$** where **$s \in S$** and **$|S|=n$**.


---

# Probability theory

- This then gives us a more general definition for the probability of an event **$E$** as the sum of all the probabilities of the outcomes related to event **$E$**.


---

# Probability theory

<div>
$$
p(E)=\sum_{s \in E}{p(s)}
$$
</div>

---

# Probability theory

- **$p(E_1 \cup E_2)=p(E_1)+p(E_2)-p(E_1 \cap E_2)$**
- **$p(\overline{E})=1-p(E)$**


---

# Conditional Probability

- Given a six-sided dice, what is the probability that the sum of two rolls is **divisible by three**?


---

# Conditional Probability

- Supposing the ordered pair **$(u,v)$** corresponds to the outcome rolling **$u$**  and then rolling **$v$**, the event described above corresponds to the following set: **$\{(1,2),(2,1),(1,5),(5,1),(2,4),(4,2),(3,3)\}$**.
- Since each of the outcomes in this event have the probability **$\frac{1}{36}$**, the probability that the sum of two rolls is divisible by three is **$\frac{7}{36}$**.


---

# Conditional Probability

- How would the probability change, if we change the scenario, such that the first die roll is **$2$**?


---

# Conditional Probability

- "the **conditional probability** of two rolls being divisible by three given that the first roll is 2"


---

# Conditional Probability

- A conditional probability is often denoted by **$p(E|F)$** where **$E$** is the desired event and **$F$** is the assumed event.


---

# Conditional Probability

- We can answer these probability questions by imagining a sample space where all first dice rolls are **$2$**, **$F=\{(2,1),(2,2),(2,3),(2,4),(2,5),(2,6)\}$**.
- We then look at the set of outcomes where both **$E$** and **$F$** is satisfied (the first roll is 2 and the sum of both rolls is divisible by three) or the set **$E \cap F=\{(2,1),(2,4)\}$**.
- This means that the **$E|F$** occurs 2 out of 6 times, giving us the conditional probability **$p(E|F)=\frac{1}{3}$**.


---

# Conditional Probability

<div>
$$
p(E|F)=\frac{p(E \cap F)}{p(F)}
$$
</div>

---

# Conditional Probability

- Given **$H$** as the event that the second flip is heads, and **$T$** as the event that the first flip is tails, we solve for **$p(H|T)$**:


---

# Conditional Probability

<div>
$$
\begin{aligned}
p(H|T)&=\frac{p(H \cap T)}{p(T)}=\frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{2}}\\
\\
p(H|T)&=\frac{1}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$
</div>

---

# Independence

- When you think about it, the outcome of the first coin flip **does not actually affect** the outcome of the second coin flip.
- In fact you can remove the first roll out of the picture and restate the question as the following: **"*what is the probability of  flipping a heads*"**.
- The probability of this event is exactly the same as the probability of **$p(H|T)$**.
-  Whenever **$p(H|T)=p(H)$**, we can conclude that the events **$H$** and **$T$** are **independent**.


---

# Independence

> **$E$** and **$F$** are independent if and only if $p(E \cap F)=p(E)p(F)$
> **$p(E \cap F)=p(E)p(F)$** is just algebraic manipulation of **$p(E|F)=p(E)$**.


---

# Bernoulli Trials and Binomial Distributions

- Performing an experiment that can only have two outcomes (such as flipping a coin) has a special name, it is called a **Bernoulli trial**.
- Since the trial can only have two outcomes (generally called successes and failures), we can infer that the probability of successes, **$p$** and the probability of failures, **$q$** will sum up to 1, ($p+q=1$).


---

# Bernoulli Trials and Binomial Distributions

- Given **$p$** as the probability of success and **$q$** as the probability of failure in a trial, we can solve for the probability of having **$k$** successes in **$n$** mutually independent trials:


---

# Bernoulli Trials and Binomial Distributions

> When **$n$** trials is performed, there are a total of **$2^n$** possible outcomes. The number of ways exactly **$k$** successes appear in **$n$** trials is exactly **$C(n,k)$**. Since each of these ways have the probability **$p^k q^{n-k}$** (because each trial is mutually exclusive we can just multiply all probabilities). Therefore, the probability of having exactly **$k$** successes is:
> <div> $$ b(k;n,p)=C(n,k)p^k q^{n-k} \\ $$ </div>
> The probability of a observing **$k$** successes in **$n$** mutually exclusive Bernoulli trials with probability success **$p$** is denoted by **$b(k;n,p)$**.

# Bernoulli Trials and Binomial Distributions

> Since the value of each digit in a 6-bit string is a independent from the other digits, and a digit can only be either a 0 (success) and a 1 (failure), we can restate this as the following probability: **$b(4,6,0.5)$**. Therefore, this probability is:
> <div> $$ b(4,6,0.5)=C(6,4)0.5^40.5^2=0.2345375 \\ $$ </div>

# Bayes' Theorem

- What is the probability that the selected box is box B (lets call this **$p(B)$)? The answer is very straightforward, since box B is one event out of 3 possible outcomes in the sample space, the probability is **$\frac{1}{3}$**.

# Bayes' Theorem

- How does event **$b$** affect the probability that this box is box B? Does this increase or decrease the probability that this is box B?


---

# Bayes' Theorem

<div>
$$
0=p(R|b)<p(M|b)<p(B|b)
$$
</div>

---

# Bayes' Theorem

- At the start of the scenario, we are able to calculate that the probability of the selected box being box B, is **$p(B)=\frac{1}{3}$**.
- We call this probability the **prior** probability (since the probability is before any evidence is gathered).
- After gathering some **evidence** by randomly picking a ball inside the selected box (event **$b$) we update our intuition about the probability of the selected box being B.
- We know denote this probability as **$p(B|b)$**.


---

# Bayes' Theorem

- What exactly is **$p(B|b)$**? Before we answer that, let us derive Bayes' theorem by looking at a general scenario:


---

# Bayes' Theorem

- Given some event **$Q$**, and some evidence **$R$**, what is the probability of **$Q$** occurring after observing the evidence **$R$** (i.e.
- **$p(Q|R)$**), if evidence **$R$** occurs in **$Q$** with the probability **$p(R|Q)$**?

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(Q) &= P(R|Q) + P(\overline{R}|Q)\\

\end{aligned}
$$
</div>

---

# Bayes' Theorem

- The sample space can be divided into two outcomes **$Q$** and **$\overline{Q}$** (either **$Q$** occurs or **$Q$** doesn't occur),


---

# Bayes' Theorem

![bayes5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HowDoIGitHelp/CMSC57CoursePack/master/Lecture%20Notes/Media/counting%20and%20probability/bayes5.jpg)

---

# Bayes' Theorem

- Within the outcome **$p(Q)$**, the evidence **$R$** has the probability of being observed as **$p(R|Q)$**.
- Therefore to figure out **$p(Q|R)$**, we just need to look at the proportion of the occurrences of **$R|Q$**, among all occurrences of **$Q$** in the sample space,

# Bayes' Theorem

![bayes6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HowDoIGitHelp/CMSC57CoursePack/master/Lecture%20Notes/Media/counting%20and%20probability/bayes6.jpg)

---

# Bayes' Theorem

- Suppose the size of the sample space is **$|S|$**, we can represent the total number of **$|Q|$** occurences as **$p(Q)|S|$**.
- That's because **$p(Q)$** is basically the ratio of **$|Q|$** occurences divided by all possible outcomes:


---

# Bayes' Theorem

<div>
$$
\begin{aligned}
p(Q)&=\frac{|Q|}{|S|}\\
p(Q)|S|&=\frac{|Q|}{|S|}|S|\\
\\
p(Q)|S|&=|Q|
\end{aligned}
$$
</div>

---

# Bayes' Theorem

> You can think of **$|S|$** as the total area of the overall  rectangle and **$p(Q)|S|$** as the total area of the two rectangles in the left side.


---

# Bayes' Theorem

- Using the same reasoning we can figure out the number of occurrences corresponding the event **$R|Q$**.
- Since there are **$p(Q)|S|$** occurrences where **$Q$** is the outcome, **$p(R|Q)p(Q)|S|$** is the number of occurrences corresponding the event **$R|Q$**.
- Also, with the same reasoning **$p(R|\overline{Q})p(\overline{Q})|S|$** is the number of occurrences corresponding the event **$R|\overline{Q}$**.


---

# Bayes' Theorem

- Therefore, the probability **$p(Q|R)$** can be calculated as:


---

# Bayes' Theorem

<div>
$$
\begin{aligned}
p(Q|R)=\frac{p(R|Q)p(Q)|S|}{p(R|Q)p(Q)|S|+p(R|\overline{Q})p(\overline{Q})|S|}
\end{aligned}
$$
</div>

---

# Bayes' Theorem

- cancelling out **$|S|$** on the numerator and denominator gives us the definition of Bayes' theorem:


---

# Bayes' Theorem

<div>
$$
\begin{aligned}
p(Q|R)=\frac{p(R|Q)p(Q)}{p(R|Q)p(Q)+p(R|\overline{Q})p(\overline{Q})}
\end{aligned}
$$
</div>

---

# Bayes' Theorem

- **$p(Q|R)$** - the **posterior** probability, or the probability that Q occurs after observing evidence **$R$** occurred
- **$p(Q)$** - the **prior** probability, or the probability of **$Q$** before observing the evidence
- **$p(R|Q)$** - the **likelihood of the R given Q** or the probability of **$R$** occurring specifically on **$Q$** outcomes


---

# Bayes' Theorem

> If the general probability of the evidence **$p(R)$** is known, the theorem can be written like the following:
> <div> $$ \begin{aligned} p(Q|R)=\frac{p(R|Q)p(Q)}{p(R)} \\ \end{aligned} $$ </div>


---

# Bayes' Theorem

- To answer the question earlier, what exactly is the probability of the selected box being the box B, given that one of the balls is blue, or the posterior, **$p(B|b)$**?


---

# Bayes' Theorem

- The prior probability **$p(B)=\frac{1}{3}$**.
- The likelihood of picking blue balls in box B is **$p(b|B)=1$**.
- The likelihood of picking blue balls in boxes that are not B (either R or M) can be calculated as,  **$p(b|\overline{B})=p(b|R \cup M) = \frac{p(b \cap (R \cup M))}{p(R \cup M)} = \frac{1}{4}$**.


---

# Bayes' Theorem

> **$\frac{1}{4}$** is calculated using the following lemma**: **$p(b \cap (R \cup M))= p(b|R)p(R)+p(b|M)p(M)$
> The proof of this lemma, (recall conditional probability)


---

# Bayes' Theorem

> $$ \begin{aligned} p(b|R)p(R)+p(b|M)p(M)&=\frac{p(b \cap R)}{p(R)}p(R)+\frac{p(b \cap M)}{p(M)}p(M)\ &=p(b \cap R)+p(b \cap M) - 0\ &=p(b \cap R)+p(b \cap M) - p((b \cap R) \cap (b \cap M))*\\
&=p((b \cap R) \cup p(b \cap M))\\
&=p(b \cap (R \cup  M))
\end{aligned}
$$
*$p((b \cap R) \cap (b \cap M))=0$** because a box cannot be both R and M at the same time, therefore there is zero probability that this intersection of events happens. I added this so that the use of union of events theorem is clearer.


---

# Bayes' Theorem

> Therefore we get **$\frac{1}{4}$** like this: $$ \begin{aligned} p(b|\overline{B})&=p(b|R \cup M)\\&=\frac{p(b \cap (R \cup M))}{p(R \cup M)}\\&=\frac{p(b|R)p(R)+p(b|M)p(M)}{p(R \cup M)}\ &=\frac{0(\frac{1}{3})+\frac{1}{2}(\frac{1}{3})}{\frac{2}{3}}\ p(b|\overline{B})&=\frac{3}{12}=\frac{1}{4} \end{aligned} $$


---

# Bayes' Theorem

- Therefore the posterior probability **$p(B|b)$**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
p(B|b)&=\frac{p(b|B)p(B)}{p(b|B)p(B)+p(b|\overline{B})p(\overline{B})}\\

- This seems like a strange formula but if you imagine the squared difference **$(X-E(X))^2$** as a random variable, then you can calculate its expected value as the weighted average of squared deviations from the mean:
